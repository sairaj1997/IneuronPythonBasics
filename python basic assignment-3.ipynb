    "#1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANS.functions help in reusal of the code.By using fucntions there is no requirement to write the statements repeatedly,it increases readability and eases code updation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",

    "#5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans.One global scope can be defined outside the function where as local scopes can be defined inside a function and exisits only till the execution of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans.The variables get deleted from the local scope as soon as the function execution finishes,they dont exist in the memory after function execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans.A return is a value that the function returns as soon as it finishes its execution when called by a function call.yes it is possible to have a return value in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans.None is returned by default if a function does not have any return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans.By using global keyword.\n",
    "\n",
